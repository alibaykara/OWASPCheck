**OWASPCheck.py: A Simple OWASP Top 10 Vulnerability Scanner**

### Introduction
OWASPCheck.py is a simple Python-based vulnerability scanning tool designed to detect common security vulnerabilities listed in the OWASP Top 10. OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) publishes this list to highlight the most common and critical web application security threats. OWASPCheck.py provides an effective solution for developers and security professionals looking to ensure basic security controls in web applications.

### What is OWASP Top 10?
The OWASP Top 10 is a guide updated every few years that lists the most common security threats. It is a key reference point in security testing, covering the most frequently encountered vulnerabilities in web applications. The latest version of the OWASP Top 10 includes the following categories:

1. **Broken Access Control**
2. **Cryptographic Failures**
3. **Injection**
4. **Insecure Design**
5. **Security Misconfiguration**
6. **Vulnerable and Outdated Components**
7. **Identification and Authentication Failures**
8. **Software and Data Integrity Failures**
9. **Security Logging and Monitoring Failures**
10. **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**

### How Does OWASPCheck.py Work?
OWASPCheck.py allows users to quickly identify basic security vulnerabilities in their web applications. Written in Python, this tool runs tests on a specified URL to check for common security issues related to the OWASP Top 10.

#### Key Features:
- **Injection Testing:** Detects vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and Cross-site Scripting (XSS).
- **Authentication and Authorization Checks:** Identifies issues like weak password policies and incorrect authorization structures.
- **Insecure Configurations:** Tests for weak configurations, such as default passwords or unnecessary open services.
- **Comprehensive Reporting:** Provides a summary report of the scan results.

### How to Use OWASPCheck.py
OWASPCheck.py is designed to be user-friendly for anyone with basic Python knowledge. Below is a step-by-step guide to using the tool:

#### 1. Clone the Project
First, clone the project to your local environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alibaykara/OWASPCheck.git
```

#### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory
After cloning the project, navigate to the directory:

```bash
cd OWASPCheck
```

#### 3. Install Required Dependencies
Install the necessary Python libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 4. Start the Scan
To run OWASPCheck.py and scan a target, use the following command:

```bash
python owaspchecker.py -t www.example.com -o results.txt
```

- The `-t` flag specifies the target URL to scan.
- The `-o` flag specifies the file where the scan results will be saved (e.g., `results.txt`).

Once executed, OWASPCheck will scan the target site for common security vulnerabilities based on the OWASP Top 10 and save the results to the specified file.

### Example Usage Steps
Here is a quick reference for scanning a website with OWASPCheck.py:

1. **Clone the project:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alibaykara/OWASPCheck.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd OWASPCheck
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Start the scan:**
   ```bash
   python owaspchecker.py -t www.example.com -o results.txt
   ```

### Results and Reporting
At the end of the scan, the specified file (e.g., `results.txt`) will contain the results of the security checks against the OWASP Top 10. The report will detail vulnerabilities found in the target web application, such as SQL injection, misconfigurations, or security risks associated with outdated components.

### Conclusion
OWASPCheck.py is a simple yet effective vulnerability scanner focused on OWASP Top 10 risks, offering a quick and easy solution for developers and security professionals. Such tools play a critical role in secure software development processes and help detect security vulnerabilities early. OWASPCheck.py is a practical tool for basic security scans and offers an ideal solution for initial security testing.
